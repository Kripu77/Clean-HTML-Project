        <h3>HTML5 and CSS3</h3>

        <p>This weeks lecture was all about on revision of concpets that is included with <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> . These two are the backbone of web development and carry the process invloved in Web Development together.
          It was great to have revision on these concepts and the definition explained by the lecturer for <strong>HTML</strong>  which is a markup language and used to present information about any content in a distinct way made my understanding more clear.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, I also understood that it is used in describing the structure of Web Pages. The foremost factor about <strong>HTML</strong> is to understand the elements that are used in the process. It is how the browser knows what content to interpret and in what sort of format.
            For Example: we use heading tag in a squential order to define the hirearchy of headings, Paragraph tag for defining a paragrapgh, anchor tag for navigating over links.
            I was absolutely amazed when the lecturer explained about the evolution of HTML and how in the neewer version of <strong>HTML</strong> i.e. <strong>HTML5</strong> new tags are introduced which helps is aiding the SEO optimisation process to reach broder specturm of Internet Users.   </p>  <p>
        
                As the lecture progressed the lecturer explained about <strong>CSS</strong> which stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheet</strong> which is used in defining and alerting the apperance of all the HTML elements.
               This made me understand how intergrally these two languages are related to each other. The lecturer justified and demonstarted how colors, back-ground colors, font-size, font-color and other phenomenal styling can be done with the help of CSS.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        The lecturer demonstrated how <strong>CSS</strong> can be used and how external <strong>CSS</strong> file can be used in any of our project. It can be either directly added to the specific element using the style synatax or to the head of the <strong>HTML page</strong> or, it can be linked from an external source. The Lecturer also explained the specifity of <strong>CSS</strong> and the inline <strong>CSS</strong> being the strongest among all other forms that are available.
