        <h2> Server-side Development</h2>
        <p>The lecturer begun the lecture with the explanation about what server side development is, which bascially refers to ideas to generate dynamic content using programming language such as <strong>PHP, ASP.NET, Node,js, </strong> etc.
            the most fascinating stuff about various langauages available is they do one thing in common which is to generate <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>  despite being dynamically different than each other. </p>

    </figure>
    <p>The lecturer explained that similar to <strong>JavaScript, PHP</strong> is also a dynamically typed language and the major factor to know was the syntax for loops, conditionals and operators are almost identical to <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
    The concept is only a bit different when we reach to the point of function, classes and while defining variable which is by using a "$" sign while declaring.
    <br>
    <br>
    The lecturer also described that the <strong>PHP</strong> files have an extension of .php and the opening and closing tag which is abit different than any other languages I have encountered so far.
    The nature of <strong>PHP</strong> and how it is written is a bit of jargon when the concpets are quite unclear.
