<h3>What is Javascript</h3>
<p>This week's lecture started with a general introduction of <strong>JavaScript</strong> a widely used client side scripting language and introduced by Netscape in 1996.
The lecturer explained about the latest version of JS which happens to be the <strong>ES6</strong> which was introduced in 2015 and brought some new features with the introduction of concepts such as <strong>let, const</strong>  which has block scope and <strong> arrow function </strong> which are typically used in writing functions in an more cleaner way and effective way.
<br>
<br>
The lecturer explained about various important concepts such as how to declare and intiliaze variable in <strong>JavaScript</strong> , which is by either using Var, Let, or Const keyword. Furthermore, the lecturer also explained various forms of Loops such as While Loop, Do while Loop and For Loop which can be applied to make our program more efficient. 
It was intresting to know how <strong>JavaScript</strong> is used to manipulate the <strong>Document Object Model</strong> and make the site respond according to user activites. 
<br><br>
Additionally, the lecturer explained how the forms with multiple inputs works and communicate with our data servers with various requests. The lecturer also explained about various libraries of <strong>JavaScript</strong> available such as React.js, Vue.jS, Angular.js. It was very fascinating to know how the use of <strong>JavaScript</strong> has gotten a bigger grasp on the server side scripting with the introduction of Node.js and simplified the process in learning.
