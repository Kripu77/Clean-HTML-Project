     <h2> Introduction to Internet technology and web development </h2>
     <p>The first week the lecturer gave and brief overview of the unit and then we had  revision on the fundamental concepts that is used in the World Wide Web along
    with brief introduction to server side programming. </p>

    <section>
        <h3>Internet Protocols</h3>
<p>We discussed about the various <strong>Internet Protocols </strong> and why as a web developer I need to have an understanding of these concepts. <br>
   As I already had some understanding that  <Strong> Internet Protocols   </Strong> are the ones who are responsible in maintaining data transimission and connect the World Wide Web. But, the best part was to closely know how various protocols such as:  </p>
      <ul>
          <li> <strong>HTTP:</strong> which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and is used to maintain the web communication. </li>
          <li> <strong>SSH:</strong> which stands for Secure Shell Protocol and enables the CLI connection driectly to the server.</li>
          <li> <strong>FTP:</strong> Which stands for file trasnfer protocol and is responsible for the transimission of files between two or more computers.</li>
          <li> <strong>POP/IMAP/SMTP:</strong> I was unknown about this protocol until this lecture and this protocol is used in email storage and sending process.</li>
          <li> <strong>DNS:</strong> which stands for Domain Name System and is used in order to resolve domain names to IP addresses.</li>
      </ul>

<p>Furthermore, as the class progressed we studied about other important concepts in which one of them was to understand how the domain name system works in together.
On the other hand, it was astonishing to know that all the internet communication occurs under water which means there are numerous of fiber optic cable being passed across the oceans around the globe.
<br>
<br>

As the lecture progressed our lecturer explained about <strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</strong> which is specifically used in requesting resources from the server which the information that we want to fetch is stored.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand whenever we do a GET request to a server with this information I understood why the information is who on the URL handler along with our queries.
The major learning from this lecture was about <Strong>Web Server </Strong> which I wasn't quite aware about. 
<br>
<br>
The simple and clear definition that I learned is Web server are a computer which tackles and repsonds accordinlgy to our HTTP requests. On the other hand, I also got to know that in order to operate these powerful servers they need to have application stack included in them.
Among many I was closely interested to know about the scripting langauge for handling the user request which in our case is PHP. PHP stands for Personal Homepages and is very dynamic and scalable.
